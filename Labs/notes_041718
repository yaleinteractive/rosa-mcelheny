$date = strtotime() == use this to make a string value into a date in unix epoch

time() = returns current time in unix epoch

use value attribute in input field to put in a default

<?= $date ?> = means just echo the variable; shortcut for outputting a variable

you can use a type=hidden with an input so that it still passes it but it's not visible or editable
